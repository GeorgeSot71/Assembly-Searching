# Assembly-Searching
Some common algorithms like binary search, exponential search and interpolation search implemented in Mips Assembly

# What I learned

- How registers work on Mips
- How branches work fundementally
- How conditional statements work fundementally
- How memory works (load, store, stack pointer, global pointer)
